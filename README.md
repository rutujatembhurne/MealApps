# MealApps
This is a web application that allows users to search for meals using an API and display the search results on the frontend. 
The app is built using vanilla JavaScript, with no libraries or frameworks allowed for JavaScript. However, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap can be used for styling.
# Features
*Home Page: The home page provides a search bar where users can type and search for meals. As the user types, the search results are updated dynamically, similar to Google's suggestion
*Favourite Meals: Each search result displayed on the home page has a favourite button. Clicking on this button adds the meal to the user's list of favourite meals.
*Meal Detail Page: Clicking on any search result (meal) opens a new page with more information about that meal. 
  The meal detail page displays the meal's name, photo, instructions, and any additional information you choose to include.
 # Problem Statement
  The goal of this project is to create a meal app that allows users to store and search for meals. 
  The app should be implemented using only vanilla JavaScript, without the use of libraries or frameworks for JavaScript. 
  However, CSS frameworks like Bootstrap can be used for styling purposes.
